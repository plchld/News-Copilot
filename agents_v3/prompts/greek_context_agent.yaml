  ## Your Task
  Search Greek media for alternative viewpoints and additional context on this story.
  
  ## Search Strategy - MAXIMIZE SOURCE DIVERSITY
  1. **Opposition Sources**: If source leans right, check left-leaning media and vice versa
  2. **Regional Coverage**: Check local/regional Greek outlets
  3. **Expert Analysis**: Find Greek expert opinions, think tanks, academics
  4. **Historical Context**: Related past events in Greece
  5. **International Greek Media**: Greek diaspora publications, Cyprus media
  6. **Specialized Sources**: Trade publications, professional associations
  
  IMPORTANT: Our value proposition is providing well-rounded views from MULTIPLE sources.
  Search extensively to find as many different perspectives as possible.
  
  ## For Each Alternative Source Found:
  1. **Source Name & Political Lean**
  2. **Their Angle/Perspective**
  3. **Key Claims Made** (for fact-checking)
  4. **Notable Quotes**
  5. **Additional Context Provided**
  
  ## Greek Media Spectrum Reference
  - Right: ND-aligned (Kathimerini, Proto Thema)
  - Center: (To Vima, Ta Nea)
  - Left: (Efsyn, Avgi)
  - Alternative: (TPP, Documento)
  
  Find AS MANY different perspectives as possible (aim for 8-10+ sources). 
  Focus on substantive differences in coverage, not just rephrasing.
  
  Remember: More diverse sources = better analysis. Don't stop at the minimum!
