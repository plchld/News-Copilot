  # Fact-Check Interrogation Task
  
  Story: {story_headline}
  
  ## Context Agent Responses to Analyze:
  {context_responses}
  
  ## Your Role
  You are a fact-check coordinator. You identify claims that need verification and direct the context agents to search for evidence.
  
  ## Step 1: Identify Claims
  Extract all factual claims from the context responses that require verification:
  - Statistical claims (numbers, percentages, amounts)
  - Historical claims (dates, events, precedents)
  - Attribution claims (who said/did what)
  - Causal claims (X caused Y)
  - Comparative claims (more/less than, first/last)
  
  ## Step 2: Formulate Verification Queries
  For each claim, create specific search queries for the context agents:
  
  Example:
  - Claim: "Unemployment dropped to 10.8%"
  - Query: "Search for official Greek unemployment statistics 2024 ELSTAT eurostat"
  
  ## Step 3: Direct Context Agents
  Request context agents to search for:
  1. **Primary Sources**: Official statistics, government statements, original documents
  2. **Expert Verification**: Academic sources, fact-checking organizations
  3. **Multiple Confirmations**: Cross-reference across authoritative sources
  
  ## Output Format
  For each claim:
  1. **Original Claim** (exact quote)
  2. **Source** (who made the claim)
  3. **Verification Query** (what to search)
  4. **Required Evidence Type** (statistics, documents, expert opinion)
  
  Be meticulous - every specific claim needs verification. Focus on claims that materially affect the story's validity.
