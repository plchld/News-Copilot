## Prompt Caching Analysis for Your News Architecture

Yes, prompt caching could **significantly** reduce your costs, but it requires restructuring your agent approach. Let me break down both strategies:

### Current Architecture Caching Potential

With your 287 daily calls across parallel agents:

**High-Value Caching Opportunities:**
1. **Discovery Agents** - Same base prompt used daily
2. **Perspective Agents** - Each type (Greek/International/Opposing) uses identical instructions across 35 stories
3. **Synthesis Agents** - Similar structure for all stories

**Estimated Savings:**
```python
# Example: Greek Perspective Agent
base_prompt = """
Research how GREEK media is covering: {topic}
Tasks:
1. Search Greek news sources...
[500 tokens of instructions]
"""

# Without caching: 35 stories × 500 tokens = 17,500 tokens
# With caching: 500 tokens (cached) + 35 × ~50 tokens (topic) = 2,250 tokens
# Savings: ~87% on input costs for this agent type
```

### Multi-Turn Conversation Strategy (Better)

Instead of parallel independent agents, use conversational agents that build context:

```python
class ConversationalAnalysisAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.conversation = [
            {"role": "system", "content": """
            You are a news analysis agent. You'll analyze multiple stories 
            in sequence, building on previous analyses.
            
            For each story, provide:
            1. Greek perspective
            2. International perspective  
            3. Opposing views
            4. Fact verification
            [Full instructions - 1000+ tokens]
            """}
        ]
    
    def analyze_story_batch(self, stories):
        # First story - full context
        self.conversation.append({
            "role": "user", 
            "content": f"Analyze story 1: {stories[0]}"
        })
        response1 = llm.complete(self.conversation)
        
        # Subsequent stories - context builds
        self.conversation.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response1})
        self.conversation.append({
            "role": "user",
            "content": f"Analyze story 2: {stories[1]}"
        })
        # Now the full conversation (instructions + story 1) is cached
```

### Optimal Architecture for Caching

**Batch Processing by Agent Type:**
```python
# Instead of: 35 separate calls for Greek Perspective
# Do: 1 conversation with 35 turns

greek_agent = ConversationalAgent(
    base_prompt=GREEK_PERSPECTIVE_INSTRUCTIONS  # Cached after first use
)

for story in daily_stories:
    analysis = greek_agent.analyze_next(story)  # Reuses cached context
```

### Cost Impact Analysis

**Current Architecture with Basic Caching:**
- Original: 287 calls × ~1,500 tokens average = 430,500 tokens
- With prompt caching: ~150,000 tokens (65% reduction)
- Cost reduction: ~$0.30 → $0.10/day (Gemini)

**Multi-Turn Architecture with Optimal Caching:**
- 7 conversational sessions (one per agent type)
- Each handles multiple stories in sequence
- Estimated tokens: ~75,000 total (83% reduction)
- Cost: ~$0.05/day (Gemini)

### Implementation Recommendations

1. **Group Similar Analyses:**
   ```python
   # Process all Greek perspectives together
   greek_session = CachedSession(GREEK_TEMPLATE)
   for story in stories:
       greek_session.analyze(story)  # Builds on cached context
   ```

2. **Use Structured Templates:**
   ```python
   ANALYSIS_TEMPLATE = """
   [CACHED SECTION - 1000 tokens]
   You are analyzing news stories with these criteria...
   Always follow this exact format...
   
   [VARIABLE SECTION - 50-100 tokens per story]
   Current story: {story_summary}
   """
   ```

3. **Batch by Time Windows:**
   - Morning batch: Process all discovery at once
   - Afternoon batch: Process all analyses together
   - Utilize 5-minute cache windows effectively

### Platform-Specific Caching Benefits

**Claude (Best for your case):**
- 90% discount on cached content
- 5-minute cache window
- Perfect for processing 35 stories in batches

**GPT-4.1:**
- 75% discount on cached content
- Good for high-frequency patterns

**Gemini:**
- 75% discount with context caching
- Best for very long contexts (1M+ tokens)

### Recommended Architecture Change

```python
class NewsIntelligencePipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.discovery_session = CachedConversation(
            "Discover top news across categories..."
        )
        self.analysis_session = CachedConversation(
            "Analyze stories from multiple perspectives..."
        )
    
    async def daily_analysis(self):
        # Phase 1: Single conversation for all discovery
        all_stories = await self.discovery_session.discover_all_categories()
        
        # Phase 2: Single conversation for all perspectives
        for batch in chunk(all_stories, size=5):
            await self.analysis_session.analyze_batch(batch)
```

This reduces your 287 calls to ~20-30 calls while maintaining the same analysis depth, potentially saving 85-90% on API costs.
