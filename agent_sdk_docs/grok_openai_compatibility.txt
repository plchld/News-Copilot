The Hitchhiker's Guide to Grok
Welcome! In this guide, we'll walk you through the basics of using the xAI API.

Step 1: Create an xAI Account
Carefully select your sign-up email. We cannot change your xAI account's email once you have signed-up.

You need to sign-up with a new email address and optionally delete the original account.

First, you'll need to create an xAI account to access xAI API. Sign up for an account here.

Once you've created an account, you'll need to load it with credits to start using the API.

Step 2: Generate an API Key
Create an API key via the API Keys Page in the xAI API Console.

After generating an API key, we need to save it somewhere safe! We recommend you export it as an environment variable in your terminal or save it to a 
.env
 file.

bash (Mac)


export XAI_API_KEY="your_api_key"
Step 3: Make your first request
With your xAI API key exported as an environment variable, you're ready to make your first API request.

Let's test out the API using 
curl
. Paste the following directly into your terminal.

bash


curl https://api.x.ai/v1/chat/completions \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer $XAI_API_KEY" \
-d '{
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are Grok, a highly intelligent, helpful AI assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"
        }
    ],
    "model": "grok-3",
    "stream": false,
    "temperature": 0
}'
Step 4: Make a request from Python or Javascript
Our API is fully compatible with the OpenAI and Anthropic SDKs. For example, we can make the same request from Python or Javascript like so:


python


# In your terminal, first run:
# pip install openai

import os
from openai import OpenAI

XAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
client = OpenAI(
    api_key=XAI_API_KEY,
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
)

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-3",
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "You are Grok, a highly intelligent, helpful AI assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"
        },
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
Certain models (such as 
grok-3
, 
grok-3-mini
, and 
grok-2-vision-1212
) also support Structured Outputs, which allows you to enforce a schema for the LLM output.

For an in-depth guide about using Grok for text responses, check out our Chat Guide.

Step 5: Use Grok to analyze images
Certain grok models can accept both text AND images as an input. For example:


python


import os
from openai import OpenAI

XAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("XAI_API_KEY")
image_url = "https://science.nasa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/web-first-images-release.png"

client = OpenAI(
    api_key=XAI_API_KEY,
    base_url="https://api.x.ai/v1",
)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {
                "type": "image_url",
                "image_url": {
                    "url": image_url,
                    "detail": "high",
                },
            },
            {
                "type": "text",
                "text": "What's in this image?",
            },
        ],
    },
]

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="grok-2-vision-latest",
    messages=messages,
    temperature=0.01,
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
And voila! Grok will tell you exactly what's in the image:

This image is a photograph of a region in space, specifically a part of the Carina Nebula, captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. It showcases a stunning view of interstellar gas and dust, illuminated by young, hot stars. The bright points of light are stars, and the colorful clouds are composed of various gases and dust particles. The image highlights the intricate details and beauty of star formation within a nebula.

Monitoring usage
As you use your API key, you will be charged for the number of tokens used. For an overview, you can monitor your usage on the xAI Console Usage Page.

If you want a more granular, per request usage tracking, the API response includes a usage object that provides detail on prompt (input) and completion (output) token usage.

json


"usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": 41,
  "completion_tokens": 87,
  "total_tokens": 128,
  "prompt_tokens_details": {
    "text_tokens": 41,
    "audio_tokens": 0,
    "image_tokens": 0,
    "cached_tokens": 0
  }
}
If you send requests too frequently or with long prompts, you might run into rate limits and get an error response. For more information, read Consumption and Rate Limits.
