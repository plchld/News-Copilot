# Configuration Directory - IMPORTANT TRANSPARENCY NOTICE

This directory contains configuration files that can significantly affect the analysis results provided by News-Copilot.

## ⚠️ Bias Warning

Any configuration that filters, excludes, or prioritizes certain sources introduces bias into the analysis. We believe in full transparency about these mechanisms.

## Files in this directory:

### `low_quality_sites.yml`
- **Purpose**: Defines websites that may be excluded from search results
- **Default**: EMPTY - no sites are excluded by default
- **Impact**: Excluding sites can limit perspectives and introduce bias
- **User Rights**: 
  - You can view this file at any time
  - You can disable exclusions in your analysis
  - You can request changes or challenge exclusions
  - You will be notified when exclusions are applied

## Principles

1. **Transparency First**: All filtering mechanisms must be visible and documented
2. **User Control**: Users should always have the option to override these settings
3. **No Hidden Bias**: We will never secretly filter or manipulate results
4. **Open to Challenge**: These configurations should be regularly reviewed and open to public scrutiny

## How to Customize

Users can:
1. Fork this repository and modify configurations
2. Use API parameters to override default behaviors
3. Request "unfiltered" analysis mode
4. Submit issues to challenge any exclusions

## Contributing

If you believe a site should be excluded or included, please:
1. Open an issue with clear evidence
2. Provide specific, verifiable reasons
3. Consider the impact on diverse perspectives
4. Respect that others may disagree

Remember: The goal is to help users think critically, not to think for them.
