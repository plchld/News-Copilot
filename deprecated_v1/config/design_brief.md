# Product Design Document: AI-Driven News Brief App

## Product Vision
Create a news consumption experience that treats attention as sacred. An antidote to information overload that delivers exactly what matters in a format that respects both time and intelligence.

**Think The New York Times meets Spotify meets a luxury watch website. Every pixel should feel expensive.**

## Core Design Principles

### 1. **Finite Over Infinite**
No endless scrolling. Each day presents a complete, digestible package. When you're done, you're done.

### 2. **Depth on Demand**
Start with the essential. Complexity reveals itself only when requested. Like peeling an onion, not drowning in soup.

### 3. **Trust Through Transparency**
Show how conclusions were reached. Multiple perspectives visible. Bias acknowledged, not hidden.

### 4. **Calm Technology**
The interface should lower blood pressure, not raise it. Think meditation app meets quality newspaper.

## User Journey

### Entry: The Anti-Hook
**Unlike social media's "what are you missing?" anxiety, we lead with completion: "Here's everything you need to know. Nothing more."**

Landing emphasizes:
- Finite consumption ("5 stories, 5 minutes")
- Completeness ("Then you're done")
- Quality over quantity ("What actually matters")

### Onboarding: Behavioral Calibration
**Problem**: People lie about their interests (say they like "international news" but only read sports)

**Solution**: Learn through action, not surveys
- Show real recent headlines
- Track engagement behavior
- Build preference model from actions
- Show inferred preferences for confirmation

### Daily Experience: The Brief

#### Morning Arrival
User opens app to see:
```
Thursday, May 29
Your Brief: 5 stories, 5 minutes
[Audio] [Read]
```

The number is intentionally small. Achievable. Finite.

#### Consumption Modes

**Audio Mode**: 
- Professional narration
- Podcast-quality production
- Stories flow naturally with transitions
- Visual cards sync with audio progress

**Reading Mode**:
- All stories visible at once
- Scannable but not overwhelming
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Progressive disclosure on tap

#### The Story Card
Each story appears as a dense but digestible card:

```
[CATEGORY TAG]                      [READ TIME]

Headline That Captures the Essence

A paragraph that delivers the core facts without
editorializing. What happened, why it matters,
written for clarity not clicks.

[subtle indicators if story has timeline/perspectives/social pulse]
```

### Deep Dive: Progressive Layers

When user taps a story, it doesn't navigate away - it expands in place, revealing:

#### Layer 1: The Full Summary
- 200 words of clear, jargon-explained coverage
- Inline explanations for complex terms
- "Why this matters to you" context

#### Layer 2: The Timeline
Visual timeline showing story evolution:
- Key events marked on a line
- Tap any point for that moment's context
- See how narrative changed over time

#### Layer 3: The Spectrum
How different sources frame the story:
- Visual spectrum from left to right
- Key language differences highlighted
- Not "bias scores" but actual framing examples

#### Layer 4: The Social Pulse
Curated social insights (not raw feeds):
- Top genuine question being asked
- Most common misconception + correction
- General sentiment temperature

### Following Stories
For ongoing stories, users can "follow":
- Get notified only on major developments
- No constant updates
- Story builds context over time

## Design Language

### Visual Aesthetics
**Dark Premium**: Like reading in a quiet library at night
- Rich blacks, not pure black
- Subtle textures and gradients
- Typography that commands respect
- Generous whitespace

### Motion Principles
Every animation has purpose:
- **Expansion**: Content revealing more detail
- **Morphing**: Smooth state transitions
- **Floating**: Subtle life in static elements
- **Spring physics**: Natural, not mechanical

### Information Density
**Progressive Information Architecture**:
1. **Glance** (5 seconds): Category, headline, one-line summary
2. **Scan** (30 seconds): Full card content
3. **Read** (2 minutes): Expanded story with context
4. **Explore** (5+ minutes): All layers and connections

## Key Differentiators

### What This Is NOT
- Not a news aggregator showing everything
- Not an infinite feed
- Not a social platform
- Not trying to maximize time spent

### What This IS
- A daily briefing service
- A complexity translator
- A perspective synthesizer
- A finite, completable experience

## Emotional Design Goals

Users should feel:
- **Informed, not overwhelmed**
- **Completed, not anxious**
- **Smarter, not manipulated**
- **Calm, not agitated**

## Success Metrics

Not measuring:
- Time spent in app
- Number of stories clicked
- Shares or viral mechanics

Instead measuring:
- Completion rate of daily briefs
- Comprehension (through subtle quizzes)
- Sustained usage over time
- User-reported "feeling informed"

## Design Details That Matter

### The "You're Done" Moment
When users finish their brief:
- Subtle celebration animation
- "You're caught up" message
- No "recommended" or "you might like"
- Option to explore topics deeper if desired

### The Jargon System
Complex terms get dotted underlines:
- Tap for inline explanation
- System learns what user knows
- Explanations get simpler/complex based on user

### The Trust Indicators
Subtle badges showing:
- Number of sources synthesized
- Confidence level in facts
- Last updated timestamp
- Correction notices if needed

### The Social Proof Inverse
Instead of "trending" or "most read":
- "Essential stories" based on impact
- No engagement metrics visible
- No social sharing buttons prominent
- Quality signals over popularity signals

## Platform Considerations

### Mobile First But Not Mobile Only
- Core experience optimized for one-handed phone use
- Tablet/desktop expand to use space intelligently
- Same content, adapted layout

## The Greece Context

Given research showing:
- Lowest trust in media (23%)
- High social media dependence (71%)
- Information overload fatigue
- Resistance to payment

Design responds with:
- Radical transparency in sourcing
- Anti-viral mechanics
- Calm, finite experiences

## Future Vision

Phase 1: Core brief experience
Phase 2: Topic following and story graphs
Phase 3: Community annotations (carefully moderated)
Phase 4: Personal knowledge graph building

The goal: Make being informed feel like an achievement, not a burden.
