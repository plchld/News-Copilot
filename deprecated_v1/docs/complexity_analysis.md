# Task Complexity Analysis for News-Copilot

## Analysis Types and Complexity Ratings

### 1. Jargon Explanation (Simple - Model: grok-3-mini)
**Complexity Score: 2/10**
- **Task**: Identify technical terms and provide Greek explanations
- **Why Simple**: Pattern matching, dictionary-like lookups, minimal reasoning
- **Model Recommendation**: `grok-3-mini` (only top-level agent using mini for cost savings)
- **No nested agents needed**

### 2. Alternative Viewpoints (Medium - Model: grok-3)
**Complexity Score: 5/10**
- **Task**: Search for related articles, summarize differences
- **Why Medium**: Requires search, comparison, synthesis
- **Model Recommendation**: `grok-3` (top-level agent standard)
- **No nested agents needed**

### 3. Fact-Checking (Medium - Model: grok-3)
**Complexity Score: 6/10**
- **Task**: Verify claims, cross-reference sources, assess credibility
- **Why Medium Complexity**: Multiple verification steps, but keeping it simple for cost
- **Model Recommendation**: `grok-3` (top-level agent standard)
- **Single agent approach** (no nested agents per user requirement)

### 4. Bias Analysis (High - Model: grok-3)
**Complexity Score: 8/10**
- **Task**: Analyze political lean on Greek political spectrum, emotional tone, framing techniques
- **Why Complex**: Nuanced political understanding, Greek political context, multi-dimensional analysis
- **Model Recommendation**: `grok-3` (top-level agent standard)
- **No nested agents needed**

### 5. Timeline Creation (Low - Model: grok-3)
**Complexity Score: 4/10**
- **Task**: Extract temporal information, order events chronologically
- **Why Low-Medium**: Temporal reasoning, but mostly extraction and ordering
- **Model Recommendation**: `grok-3` (top-level agent standard)
- **No nested agents needed**

### 6. Expert Opinions (Medium - Model: grok-3)
**Complexity Score: 5/10**
- **Task**: Find expert quotes, verify sources, categorize stances
- **Why Medium**: Search, attribution, stance analysis
- **Model Recommendation**: `grok-3` (top-level agent standard)
- **No nested agents needed**

### 7. X Pulse Analysis (Very High - Model: grok-3 with nested agents)
**Complexity Score: 9/10**
- **Task**: Extract keywords, search X, analyze discourse, identify themes, sentiment analysis
- **Why Very Complex**: Multi-stage analysis, discourse understanding, theme extraction
- **Model Recommendation**: `grok-3` (main coordinator)
- **Nested Agent Architecture**:
  - Main XPulseAgent (grok-3): Orchestrates the analysis
  - KeywordExtractorAgent (grok-3-mini): Extracts search keywords
  - XSearchAgent (grok-3-mini): Searches and filters X posts
  - ThemeAnalyzerAgent (grok-3): Identifies discussion themes
  - SentimentAnalyzerAgent (grok-3-mini): Analyzes sentiment per theme

## Model Selection Strategy

### Cost Optimization (Non-Fast Models Only)
1. **grok-3-mini**: Used sparingly for cost savings
   - Jargon extraction (top-level agent)
   - X Pulse sub-agents (keyword extraction, X search, sentiment)

2. **grok-3**: Standard for all top-level agents (except jargon)
   - Alternative viewpoints
   - Fact-checking
   - Bias analysis
   - Timeline creation
   - Expert opinions
   - X Pulse main coordinator
   - X Pulse theme analyzer

### Why This Distribution?
- **Quality First**: Using grok-3 for 6/7 main tasks ensures high-quality analysis
- **Strategic Cost Savings**: Only using grok-3-mini for simple jargon task and X Pulse sub-agents
- **No Fast Models**: Avoiding higher-cost fast infrastructure per user preference
- **Simplified Architecture**: Most agents are single-level, reducing complexity

### Nested Agents (X Pulse Only)
The X Pulse feature benefits from nested agents because:
- **Parallelization**: Keywords, search, and sentiment can run concurrently
- **Specialization**: Each sub-task has distinct requirements
- **Cost Efficiency**: Most sub-tasks use cheaper grok-3-mini
- **Modularity**: Easy to update individual components

### Dynamic Model Selection Factors
Agents can adjust model selection based on:
- **Article length**: Very long articles might upgrade model
- **User tier**: Premium/admin users could get grok-3 for all tasks
- **Error rates**: Fallback to higher model if mini fails
- **Language complexity**: Technical/legal content might need grok-3
